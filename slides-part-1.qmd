## Something about me

-   I like Statistics - maybe I am weird

-   I like writing - I am definitely weird

## Something about you

![](img/topics.jpg)

\[A bar chart showing survey answers to question: What would you say the field(s) of your thesis are? (feel free to add other options if not listed). Examples answers were: ML, Software Engineering. Plot is hidden in public version of workshop for protection of students' data.\]

## Your deadlines and your progress

![](img/deadline-progress.jpg)

\[Two pie charts side-by-side showing survey answers to two questions: "When do you plan to submit your thesis? "and "Honors thesis: have you started writing it?". Plots are hidden in public version of workshop for protection of students' data.\]

## The thesis you are planning to write

![](img/thesis-type.jpg)

\[A pie chart showing survey answers to the question: "As of now, what kind of thesis do you plan to write? " with options "A short-to-medium paper style, 10-20 pages" or "A longer thesis, maybe with more extensive literature review (20+ pages)". Plots are hidden in public version of workshop for protection of students' data.\]

## Your confidence

![](img/confidence.jpg){fig-align="center"}

\[A pie chart showing survey answers to the question: "Honors thesis: how confident do you feel about its format requirements (e.g. structure, length, style, etc.) " with options "I don't know much about it" or "I am 99.9% confident". Plots are hidden in public version of workshop for protection of students' data.\]

## Recurring doubts: Sections

\[Quotes from survey responses indicating need to know more about what sections are included in a honors thesis. Actual answers are hidden in public version of workshop for protection of students' data.\]

## Sections of a short thesis / paper

-   Abstract - *overview of the project*

-   Introduction - *what is your project about?*

-   Background - *what has been done before/what is known?*

-   Methods - *what did you do and how?*

-   Results - *what did you find out?*

-   Discussion - *what do your findings mean?*

. . .

We will dig into each of these more!

## Recurring doubts: Standard Format?

\[Quotes from survey responses indicating need to know more about what format/template a honors thesis should follow. Actual answers are hidden in public version of workshop for protection of students' data.\]

## A flexible thesis

*It is up to the student and their faculty advisor to determine the most appropriate form for their thesis, including questions such as exact format, page count, word count, headings, etc.*

## Choosing *your* format

-   Take a look at the examples and see which styles you like!

-   If you choose a conference paper, there usually are templates, e.g. [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) (search for others!)

-   UCI has [Word and LateX templates](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/gradmanual/templates) for a Master's or PhD thesis, which you can use too

-   Ask your advisor if they are on board with your choice

## Your challenges with writing

**Clarity**

What makes for a clear thesis or paper?

{{< fa arrow-right >}} Clarity is **global clarity** + **local** **clarity** (e.g. individual sentences, figures etc.)

## What affects overall clarity?

-   what content is included/not included

    Examples of common problems?

    -   Not explicit about what you worked on exactly

    -   Not explaining why you chose the method you used

        [A good example {{< fa magnifying-glass >}}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLAew3n71PpblH7A0lZZcYQNlAH93xum) (highlighted text in Sec 1.2, Sec. 2 and Sec. 3)

    -   Good principle: *every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed*

## What affects overall clarity?

-   how content is organized in your thesis

    -   your focus should be clear very soon

        [Do not wait until Section 3 - example {{< fa magnifying-glass >}}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RYqSqtHQm0Zh0DFPhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xvzJxw8HZFnZPXXjtFS7JGfqHjSocrtJbtRCanpAIPFHEMLr)(highlighted text in Sec 1.2, Sec. 2 and Sec. 3)

    -   you should try introduce concepts close to when you first use them

        [Define a metric, then use it - example {{< fa magnifying-glass >}}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gRAAnH8o6nkAfnyC3VDZxffvuHXireWx)

        (highlighted text in Sec. 4.1 and 4.4)

    -   can you tell what the story is?

## Ok but.. how do *I* write a clear thesis

-   Generally good idea to work a great deal on the outline, until you see that it does tell a story

    -   Sometimes advisors can help you with this, sometimes it is hard..

    -   Run the outline by a peer (ideally someone who is also writing a thesis)

    ::: callout-caution
    ## Volunteer needed

    Two people who have *made significant progress* on your thesis, come share with us your story!
    :::

## What affects local clarity?

-   Individual-sentence clarity

    Common problems:

    -   Using terminology or acronyms that you have not defined

        When I was wrong: It does *not* read as 'advanced'

        Better to use less terminology, but well defined

        Example

    -   Using metrics without defining them

        [Define a metric well - example {{< fa magnifying-glass >}}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gRAAnH8o6nkAfnyC3VDZxffvuHXireWx)

        (highlighted text in Sec. 4.1)

<!-- -->

-   Clarity of Figures and Tables

    Common problems:

    -   Throwing results at the reader without making sure they can be understood

    -   Not referencing and not making use of your Tables and Figures in the text

        [These tables have been abandoned - example {{< fa magnifying-glass >}}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cn6axcKdCeDPqJ2g-U3hsUU-Ht58SaiX) (Figure 1, 2)

## What we covered today

-   There is a structure to the thesis, but it's pretty flexible
-   Each of you knows at least one example thesis close to their thesis topic - see [Examples of thesis (and formats)](#examples-of-thesis-and-formats)
-   What makes for a clear thesis, overall
-   What makes for clear individual sentences, figures and tables

## What we are doing Friday

-   What exactly makes for good abstract, introduction, background, methods, results and discussion sections

<!-- -->

-   Tackle another one of the challenges you mentioned: how to get started

## Before we end

Last night's events at UCLA

['Horrific' violence at UCLA after counter-protesters attack pro-Palestinian camp](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68937775) (from BBC)

-   Talk to one another and keep an open mind: universities are places to grow as humans (not only academically)

-   Be compassionate and reject hate, from any side

-   As you think about other people's actions to make a change, I suggest ask yourself what *you* are doing to make a change

# The End (of Part 1)
